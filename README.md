NB:
The login will not function as we cannot directly connect to MongoDB from the client-side (browser) due to security risks and CORS restrictions. 
I am working on a backend server that the frontend can communicate with but i havent decided which to with between (Heroku or Render) after that i will make the frontend hosted with github pages make API calls to the backend.
